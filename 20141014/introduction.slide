* Why Go?
Robert Love when asked in Quora about what kind of programming language we
need in the future.

* Who is behind Go?
- Robert Pike (Unix / UTF-8)
- Kenneth Thompson (B and C lang/Unix/UTF-8)
- Ian Lance Taylor (GCC)
- Robert Griesemer (Hotspot JVM)
- Russ Cox (Plan9/CSP)
- 547 contributors as of today. For instance, Windows port was entirely
contributed by the Go community.

* Who uses Go?
- Google
- Facebook
- Heroku
- Amazon
- New York Times
- Canonical
- Github
- Hailo
- pool.ntp.org
- Shopify
- Zynga
- Somewhat complete list at https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/GoUsers

* Go's main features (1/2)
- Statically compiled but has type-inference
- Explicit coding, no magic, no meta-programming
- Fast compilations (`go build` and you're done)
- Composition over inheritance
- Duck Typing
- Functions are first class citizens
- Closures
- Pointers but not pointer arithmetic

* Go's main features (2/2)
- No exceptions, instead it provides an Error interface and encourages explicit error handling.
- Visibility is given by the case of the first letter of the type, property or function name.
- If you declare something and you don't use it, it won't compile.
- Cyclic dependencies are not allowed, makes the work of the compiler easier but also avoids questionable code design practices.
- Painless cross compilation (ignoring CGO)
- Multi-value returns

* What is not Go?
- It's not a research programming language.
- It is not a pure Object Oriented language nor a Functional one. Although it borrows things from various programming paradigms and languages.
- Probably not the best language for embedded programming of realtime applications. Although some people have used it succesfully for that. Your mileage may vary.
- It is not a scripting language like Javascript, Ruby or Python. But it was designed to feel like it.

* How do I install Go?
- *Windows:* Download MSI installer from https://golang.org/dl/. It will put the Go distribution in `C:\Go` and add `C:\Go\bin` to your PATH env variable.
- *OSX:* Download DMG package from https://golang.org/dl/. It will put the Go distribution in `/usr/local/go` and add `/usr/local/go/bin` to your PATH env variable
- *Linux:* Download the archive from https://golang.org/dl/. Create a Go tree in `/usr/local/go`. Add `/usr/local/go/bin` to the PATH environment variable `echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.profile`.
