// Poolâ€™s intended use is for free lists maintained in global variables,
// typically accessed by multiple goroutines simultaneously.
// Using a Pool instead of a custom free list allows the runtime to reclaim
// entries from the pool when it makes sense to do so. An appropriate use
// of sync.Pool is to create a pool of temporary buffers shared between
// independent clients of a global resource. On the other hand, if a free list
// is maintained as part of an object used only by a single client and freed
// when the client completes, implementing that free list as a Pool is not appropriate.
